# TourMate-bp
## Introduction
A javascript based project. was thinking of what to do in pendemic lockdown. recetly like on start of 202 i gave interview to a Austria base company tourradar so this project is base of following to online resources
[TourRadar](https://www.tourradar.com/)
[Natours](https://www.natours.dev/)

so this project is basicly a pointer to js related tips which is can be easily skipped as time passes. Any Noob Developer who wanted to explore world of JS and how things can be done in JS way can go through the project and get the insights. I never worked opensource before in my life. it has to start some day. so putting its as my 2020 reveleation since feburary 2020 and this one is first repo. Have to start from somewhere....!
